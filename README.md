# Classification Problem- Will a candidate join the company after accepting job offer?

A company, especially Human Resource team, have to spend a lot of time and money in selecting a candidate. The process on average takes 1- 4 months to hire a new employee. There is an increasing trend in which a candidate after accepting the offer, refuses to join a company. In technical terms, it is often called "renege". Higher renege means the process of hiring needs to repeated again ( Searching applicant-> Screeing ->Shortlisting->Offering the job). Add to it the cost to the company of job vacancy remaining vacant. So what is the cost to company due to high renege?
