# Classification Problem- Will a candidate join the company after accepting job offer?

A company, especially Human Resource team, have to spend a lot of time and money in selecting a candidate. The process on average takes 1- 4 months to hire a new employee. There is an increasing trend in which a candidate after accepting the offer, refuses to join a company. In technical terms, it is often called "renege". Higher renege means the process of hiring needs to repeated again ( Searching applicant-> Screeing ->Shortlisting->Offering the job). Add to it the cost to the company of job vacancy remaining vacant. So what is the cost to company due to high renege?

### Cost/Loss of vacancy to the company.

1. Annual Revenue Per Employee= Annual Revenue / Number of Employee
   Annual Revenue Per Employee = $ 155 billion /190000 = $ 8,15,790
   
2. Daily Revenue Per Employee = Annual Revenue Per Employee / 365 Days
   Daily Revenue Per Employee = 815790/365 = $ 2,235
   
3. Revenue Lost per vacant post/job= Daily Revenue per Employee * Average Days Positions Unfilled
   Revenue Lost per vacant post/job = $ 2235 * 42 days =  $93,870

This is a huge amount to company for a vacant position apart from non monetary factors like projects not being competed or other outgrowth- More work per employee, stresss etc.

Can there be a way to know to know beforehand that a an employee will not join the job after accepting offer.

This project applies Machine Learning technique (Classification -Decision Tree/Random Forest) to calculate the probability of a person joining the job

The list of variables are explained in the file.
